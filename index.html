		<p>Welcome to my first official website! I am a sophomore at Arizona State University and I am studying Organizational<br> Leadership with a focus on project management. I am also minoring in business. I like to read, hang out with friends,<br> and watch scary movies. I also have a bad habit of online shopping. I hope you enjoy exploring my website and<br> reading my resume that is linked below! </p>
